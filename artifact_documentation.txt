System Requirements:
Linux (Port forwarding confirmed to work on Linux)
Docker >= 20.0

The artifact is a docker container that can be pulled from Docker Hub using the command `docker pull sacheendra/or_char`.

The container can then be started using `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 sacheendra/or_char`.

To reproduce the graphs in the paper:
1. Start the docker container. (If you are using Docker for Mac or Windows, you might need to expose port 8888 between docker vm and host)
2. Navigate to localhost:8888 in your browser.
3. On the webpage, you should see a list of files in a pane on the left.
4. The code to reproduce the graphs in in Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks have the extension `.ipynb`.
5. The noteboks to produce the plots in the paper are numbered from 1 to 5.
6. To run a notebook, first open it by double clicking it.
7. The code in the notebook can then be run by opening the `Run` dropdown at top-left, and clicking on the `Run all cells` option.
