## Characterization of OutageReport for years 2019 and 2020

This repository contains two datasets extracted from OutageReport webpages in 2019 and 2020. One dataset of total reported failures and another of failure with detailed information.

The datasets are in the Parquet file format.

The Jupyter Notebook files read the datasets, clean them, and generate plots and numbers for characterization.

All the plots used in the paper can be generated by running the jupyter notebooks in order. The plots can also ve viewed in the notebooks themselves.

The easiest way to run the notebooks is to use the prebuilt docker container using the command `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 sacheendra/or_char`.

To reproduce the graphs in the paper:
1. Start the docker container. (If you are using Docker for Mac or Windows, you might need to expose port 8888 between docker vm and host)
2. Navigate to localhost:8888 in your browser.
3. Run the notebooks with numbers 1 to 8, and you can see the graphs.
