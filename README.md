## Characterization of OutageReport for years 2019 and 2020

This repository contains two datasets extracted from OutageReport webpages in 2019 and 2020. One dataset of total reported failures and another of failure with detailed information.

The datasets are in the Parquet file format.

The Jupyter Notebook files read the datasets, clean them, and generate plots and numbers for characterization.
